			<br>- Safety -Our drivers are experienced and licensed to operate airport transfers, and very familiar with Gauteng routes and transportation industry culture in South Africa.
			<br>- Assurance in pricing -prices are fixed at the time of booking, yet clients can still cancel without penalty
			<br>- No hidden costs, price includes toll fee, and gratuities, although drivers may accept tips
			<br>- Relaxed waiting times at airports for pick ups â€“ In spite of drivers waiting for you at airports,there are no extra costs as long as you are within free waiting period of up to 45 minutes, In other words we guarantee a fixed price at airports. However a 30 minutes waiting time applies outside airports. We use placards displaying client name for airport shuttle pick-ups.
